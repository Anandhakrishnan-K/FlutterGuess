My First Flutter project to let users to guess the number which is randomly generated by the system and rewards with points :)

Number Guesswork – This is a straightforward project, yet it’s engaging. One may even refer to it as a game. Beginners will especially benefit from this project. Develop software that allows the computer to generate a number randomly from any range. Give users a clue so they can figure out the number. The user receives another clue and loses points for each incorrect answer. Multiples, divisions, higher or lower numbers, or any combination of these could be the clue. Date: 21-Jan-23 1.Generate a random number 2.Give the clue to user to guess – Number of digits, multiples of N etc .. 3.If guess is correct 100 points. Reduce 10 points for wrong guess 4.Give more clues – like range. Reduce 20 points for extra clues 5.Give Up to reveal the Number and will get 0 points.

Inspired from a random post on trending Python projects.
